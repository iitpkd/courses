# Learning Objectives

This is an intermediate level course in computer science field and assumes background in algorithm, programming and introductory knowledge of probability and linear algebra. The main objective of the course is to introduce student with methodologies and applications of various topics of machine learning.  The course will also provide sufficient background to motivate students to take up advanced levels courses related to machine learning, deep learning, bioinformatics, robotics, Artificial intelligence etc. 

# Learning outcome

Upon successful completion, the students will be able to  implement few machine learning models like regression classification and clustering and will be able to learn models from data and evaluate models on test data.
