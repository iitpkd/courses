# Learning Objectives

This is a post-graduate level course in graph theory. The objective of the
course is to prepare the students for research in graph theory and related areas.
Learning Outcomes: By the end of this course, students will have a rigorous foundation in the key
areas of graph theory. They will be able to state, explain, prove, and apply many fundamental
results in these areas. They will be able to analyse these proofs and apply these proof techniques to
solve similar problems. They will also get confident to follow long and intricate graph theoretic
arguments. They will also be familiar with some of the major open problems in the area.
