# Learning Objectives 
To learn about major disciplines in artificial
intelligence, their fundamental differences and applicability.

# Learning Outcomes 
Students will be able to state and apply major
algorithms, methods, and theoretical results in the field of artificial
intelligence.

# Syllabus

Introduction: What is AI, agent, environment and its Applications.

Problem solving by search: principles of search, uninformed ("blind")
search, informed ("heuristic") search, constraint satisfaction problems,
adversarial search and games

Optimization methods: gradient descent, multi-objective optimization.

Knowledge representation and reasoning: rule based representations,
declarative or logical formalisms, Logic Programing and logic network.

Reasoning in uncertain environments: Genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic,
soft computing;

Learning: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement
learning. Generative discriminative models.

Probabilistic models: Bayesian models, probabilistic discriminative
models.

Discussion of practical cases from various domains: natural language
processing, computer vision, bioinformatics etc.
