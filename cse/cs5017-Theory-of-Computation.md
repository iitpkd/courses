# Course Objectives: 
The course will provide a formal connection
between algorithmic problem solving and the theory of languages and
automata and develop them into a mathematical view towards algorithmic
design and in general computation itself.

# Course Contents
**Regular Languages & Finite Automata**: Regular Languages and Regular Expressions, Deterministic and Non-deterministic Finite Automata, Kleene's Theorem, Pumping Lemma, Myhill-Nerode Theorem. (12 lectures, 4 tutorials)

**Introduction to Context-free Languages & Pushdown Automata**: Context-free Languages and Grammars, Ambiguity, Chomsky Normal Form, CYK Algorithm, Pumping Lemma, Introduction to Deterministic and Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata.  (9 lectures,  3 tutorials) 

**Turing Machines & Recursive Languages**: Mathematical modelling of computation, Deterministic Turing Machines, Church-Turing Thesis, Chomsky Hierarchy, Universal Turing Machines. Recursive and Recursively Enumerable Languages. Non-recursive Languages and Undecidable Problems, the Halting Problem. Reduction  (12 lectures, 4 tutorials) 

**Complexity: **Resource-bounded computation, Classes P and NP, Polynomial time reductions, NP-completeness. (9 lectures,  3 tutorials)

# Learning Outcomes: 
After completion of this course, a student will be able to

1.  Give the mathematical definition of various computational models and
    state and prove their limitations.
2.  To explain important notions in computing like nondeterminism,
    reductions and resource boundedness.
