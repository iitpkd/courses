# Course Objectives: 
The main objective of this course is to introduce
the fundamental tools of game theory and a few equilibrium concepts.
During this course, we will also look at applications from a variety of
disciplines and delve into some of the fascinating mathematics that
underlies game theory. This course begins with an introduction into Game
Theory. It then introduces strategic and extensive form games, and games
with societal aspects to them. Subsequently, we will move onto
understanding a few topics/concepts/ideas in mechanism design.

# Course Content

**Introduction:** Motivation, theory of rational choice, utility functions (3 lectures)

**Strategic form games: **Definition, examples, dominant strategy equilibria, pure strategy Nash equilibrium, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, existence of Nash equilibrium, computation of Nash equilibria, potential games, two player zero sum games, minimax theorem (15 lectures)

**Extensive form games: **Definition, examples, games of imperfect information, games of incomplete information, repeated games, the folk theorem of average payoffs, Nash equilibrium in repeated games with average payoff (7 lectures)

**Cooperative games:** Transferable utility games, the core, the Shapley value, Nash bargaining (5 lectures)

**Mechanism design:** Introduction, social choice functions and mechanisms, incentive compatibility and revelation theorem, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem, quasilinear mechanisms, Vickrey- Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms, auction, optimal mechanisms and Myerson auction (12 lectures)

# Learning Outcomes: 
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will:

1.  be able to differentiate between different types of games Identify
    various equilibria within games
2.  gain knowledge about fundamental concepts of non-cooperative and
    cooperative game theory
3.  be able to explain precisely, and apply solution concepts to
    examples of games
4.  be able to apply the mathematical concepts discussed over the
    duration of the course.
