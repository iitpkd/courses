**Course Objective**

To introduce the power of probability theory and randomization
techniques in computer science, with particular emphasis on analyzing
algorithms that employ randomization.

**Course Contents**

*Introduction:* Events, probability spaces, random variables,
expectation, conditional expectation, tail bounds including Markov\'s
inequality, Chebyshev\'s inequality, Chernoff bounds. Sample
applications include Karger\'s min-cut algorithm, randomized quicksort,
and permutation routing on the hypercube.

*Common Probability Distributions:* Bernoulli and binomial random
variables, geometric distribution, coupon collector\'s problem, Poisson
distribution, normal distribution, power law distributions.

*Hashing with Applications:* Balls into bins, chain hashing, Bloom
filters, pairwise independence, Chebyshev\'s inequality for pairwise
independent variables, universal hash functions, perfect hashing, the
count-min sketch, the power of two choices, cuckoo hashing.

*Probabilistic Method:* The counting argument, the expectation argument,
sample and modify, the second moment method, the conditional expectation
inequality, the Lovasz local lemma.

*Markov Chains and Random Walks:* Basic definitions, stationary
distribution, variation distance and mixing time and their relation to
graph spectrum, random walks on undirected graphs, the Monte Carlo
method, the Metropolis algorithm, coupling.

*Martingales:* Basic definitions, stopping time, Wald\'s equation,
Azuma-Hoeffding inequality.

**Learning Outcomes: **Students will be able to model probabilistic
events using random variables and analyze simple probabilistic
algorithms using probabilistic tools acquired in this course.

**Teaching Methodology : **Classroom lectures

**Assessment Methods :** Written examination
