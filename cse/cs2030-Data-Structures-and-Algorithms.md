# Learning Objectives
-   Acquire some basic mathematical tools and techniques of algorithm
    analysis.
-   To familiarise with basic data structures and to develop the ability
    to choose the appropriate data structure for designing efficient
    algorithms.
-   Learn some basic algorithms with their rigorous proofs of
    correctness and efficiency analysis of implementation using
    appropriate data structures.

# Learning Outcomes
-   To know about some basic data structures, their implementation and
    some of their standard applications.
-   To develop the ability to analyze the running time and prove the
    correctness of basic algorithms.
-   To develop the ability to design and analyze simple algorithms using
    the appropriate data structure learned in the course.

# Syllabus
Data Representation - Basic concepts of data structures; Abstract data
types; Elementary data types; Mathematical preliminaries - asymptotic
notations; efficiency of algorithms; notion of time and space
complexity; notions of best, worst and average case performance
analysis, solving simple recurrences, solving divide and conquer type
recurrences.

Computations on arrays with best and worst case performance analysis -
binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, external merge
sort, heaps and heapsort, priority queues using heaps.

Linked lists - single and doubly linked lists.

Queue and Stack data structures - array based and linked list based
implementations. Infix to postfix conversion and expression evaluation.
Graphs - Adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations, DFS, BFS.

Hash Tables - hash functions, open addressing, chaining. Trees - rooted
tree representation, traversal of trees, binary trees, expression trees.
Search Tree - binary search trees. Balanced search trees - 2-3-4 tree,
B-Tree - an external memory data structure.
