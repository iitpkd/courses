# Course Objective: 
This is a first course in computational complexity
theory designed for graduate and motivated undergraduate students that
introduces the basic time and space complexity classes, randomized
complexity class and parallel complexity classes. The students also
learn about typical problems in these classes. Through the classical
results covered, students would learn about the relations between some
of these complexity classes.

# Course Contents

1. Review of Basics Concepts. Turing Machine Model of Computation, Universal
Turing Machines, Deterministic Turing Machine and Class P. Non-deterministic
Turing Machines and Class NP.  Satisfiability and Circuit Value Problems. 
Polynomial time verifiability,  Polynomial-time reductions  and
NP-completeness. Cook-Levin Theorem and its proof, Other Time Complexity
Classes co-NP, EXP and NEXP. (8 lectures) 

2. Diagonalization: Deterministic Time Hierarchy Theorem,
Non-deterministic Time Hierarchy  Theorem (without   proof),

3. Space Complexity: Space Hierarchy Theorem. Classes PSPACE,
L, NL and co-NL, Savitch's Theorem, Configuration Graphs,
Reachability Problems,  Log space  reductions, Completeness
Results (PSPACE completeness and NL-completeness), NL=co-NL.   (6 lectures)




4. The Polynomial Hierarchy and  Circuits:  The Polynomial Hierarchy,
Alternating Turing Machines,  Circuit Model of   Computation,  Non-uniformity,

5. Randomized Computation : Probabilistic Turing Machines, Classes RP, co-RP,

list below, or any other relevant topic of choice) :   
            
Or (b) Complexity of counting  the class\#P,\# P-completeness,
Valiant's  theorem.  (8 lectures)

# Learning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of this course,
students are expected to

1.  Know and state the relationship between various complexity classes
    studied in the course
2.  State and explain the classical results in computational complexity
    theory
