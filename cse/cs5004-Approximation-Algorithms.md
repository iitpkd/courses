# Course Objective

This is an advanced elective which assumes familiarity with the basic
techniques for algorithm analysis and design. This first two parts of
this course will familiarise students to methods of dealing with hard
problems using various approximation algorithm design techniques ranging
from combinatorial techniques to more sophisticated LP based and
probabilistic methods. It will also introduce students to different
types of approximation algorithms like constant factor approximations,
PTAS and FPTAS. The last part of the course gives an exposure to widely
used reduction techniques for proving inapproximability of problems. The
concepts and techniques will be introduced using a variety of sample
illustrative problems.

**Part 1 : Combinatorial Techniques:** Basics - Review of NP Hardness and reductions, approximation factor, technique of lower bounding optimum - simple approximation for vertex cover, greedy algorithm for set cover. Minimum spanning tree heuristic - metric Steiner tree and metric TSP. Layering technique - feedback vertex set. Strong NP-Hardness and pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms - knapsack. Dynamic programming - PTAS for Euclidean TSP, FPTAS for the knapsack, asymptotic PTAS for bin packing. Local search - max-cut, facility location problem.   (15 lectures)

**Part 2 : Algorithms using LP based and probabilistic techniques: **Simple rounding - max-SAT with small clauses, set cover, bin-packing. Random sampling and derandomization - max SAT, max-cut. Randomized rounding - set cover, multiway cut. Dual fitting - set cover. Primal-dual method - set Cover, steiner forest. (15 lectures)

**Part 3 : Hardness of Approximation:** Techniques in proving the hardness of approximation: reductions from NP-complete problems, hardness of approximation of TSP, Reductions that preserve approximation, Reductions from probabilistically checkable proofs, Reductions based on unique games conjecture - tight hardness of max-cut and vertex cover. (10 lecture)
