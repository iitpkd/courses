# Course Objective

The objective of this course is to introduce the students to various
techniques in graph theory and combinatorics.

# Course Contents

Matching, Hall\'s Theorem, Kőnig\'s Theorem, Connectivity, Coloring, Planar Graphs, Eulerian Graphs, Hamiltonian cycles, Dirac\'s Theorem, Ore's Theorem.  (12 lectures)

Introduction to Ramsey Theory and Extremal Graph Theory. (8 lectures)

Ordinary, Exponential and other special Generating Functions, Formal Power Series. (10 lectures)

Linear Algebraic Arguments like Dimensionality, Orthogonality and Rank arguments. Introduction to Spectral Graph Theory. (12 lectures) 

# Learning Outcomes: 
By the end of this course, students will be able
to state, explain, prove, and apply fundamental results in graph theory
and combinatorics. They will be able to analyse these proofs and apply
these proof techniques to solve similar problems.
