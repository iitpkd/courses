# Learning Objectives

In today’s world, many safety-critical systems are automatically controlled by an embedded code (automatic cars, aircrafts, pacemakers, etc).  As the size and the number of interacting components increase, the design and verification of these control software becomes increasingly complex and highly error-prone. Model checking is a field of research that addresses this challenge by making use of rigorous mathematical techniques. The key idea is to view control software as extensions of finite-state machines - this is the “model” of the software. Verification of the software translates to “checking” if the model satisfies certain properties. This is done by an algorithmic analysis of the model.

# Learning outcome

The goal of this course is to understand the theoretical foundations of model Checking technology and get a hands-on experience with a tool that performs model checking.

# Required Background

Familiarity with basic algorithms and finite-state machines

# Syllabus

*Module 1:* Modeling software and hardware as finite state machines (automata):
Models for simple control code and hardware circuits as transition systems; properties as formal languages; introduction to NuSMV model-checker

*Module 2:* Automata theory over finite and infinite words:
Review of DFAs, NFAs, closure properties; introduction to Büchi automata, non-deterministic and deterministic Büchi automata, closure properties.
