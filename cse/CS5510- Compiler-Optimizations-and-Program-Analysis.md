# Learning Objectives:
The objective of the course is to give students a deeper perspective into the internals of a
compiler. The course equips students with the fundamentals in the theory of program
analysis and machine independent code optimizations. The programming assignment in
the course will make them expert practitioners of theory thus introduced. The program
analysis theory covered in the course is useful in exploring research areas like
language-based security, and program correctness.

# Learning Outcomes:
At the end of the course, students will be able to identify opportunities for optimizing the
programs given as input to the compiler, devise strategies to exploit them. The
programming assignment focus on implementing program analysis and optimization
passes in the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) framework. The code optimization and
code generation methods covered in the class will help students implement compiler
passes to achieve superior performance on a given hardware.
