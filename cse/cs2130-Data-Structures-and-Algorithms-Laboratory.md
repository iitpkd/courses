This is a companion lab of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. In
this course the students will learn to implement basic data structures
and to use them for implementing some of the standard algorithmic
applications they learned in the theory course.

# Syllabus

Computations on arrays - binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort,
quicksort, external merge sort, heaps and heapsort, priority queues
using heaps.

Linked lists - single and doubly linked lists.

Queue and Stack data structures - array based and linked list based
implementations. Infix to postfix conversion and expression evaluation.

Graphs - Adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations, DFS, BFS.

Binary Trees, Tree traversals, Binary search trees, B-Trees.
