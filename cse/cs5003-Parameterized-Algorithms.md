# Learning Objectives

This is an advanced level course on the design and analysis of 
algorithms for computational intractable problems. 

There are two major objectives of this course:

The first is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field
of parameterized algorithms and complexity. This includes an 
illustration of the key techniques for the design and analysis
of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and a demonstration of the
notion of fixed-parameter intractability. 

The second goal of this course is to present some of the recent 
tools and techniques (like the framework for proving lower bounds,
meta theorems, non-trivial applications of combinatorial min-max 
results and use of matroids) and prepare the students for research
in this area of algorithm design.

# Learning outcome

After the successful completion of this course, the students will be
able to study the parameterized complexity of a given problem. 

In particular, they would be able equipped to classify parameterized 
problems as being fixed-parameter tractable or intractable. They would
be able to design parameterized algorithms (or show hardness) using
vanilla versions or extended/modified variants of the various
techniques taught in the course. They would also be able to state 
open problems in the area and their current complexity statuses.
