# Course Objective

This is an advanced level course on the design and analysis of
algorithms for computational intractable problems. There are two major
objectives of this course. The first is to provide a comprehensive
introduction to the field of parameterized algorithms and complexity.
This includes an illustration of the key techniques for the design and
analysis of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and a demonstration of
the notion of fixed-parameter intractability. The second goal of this
course is to present some of the recent tools and techniques (like the
framework for proving lower bounds, meta theorems, non-trivial
applications of combinatorial min-max results and use of matroids) and
prepare the students for research in this area of algorithm design.

# Learning Outcomes

After the successful completion of this course, the students will be
able to study the parameterized complexity of a given problem. In
particular, they would be equipped to classify parameterized problems as
being fixed-parameter tractable or intractable. They would be able to
design parameterized algorithms (or show hardness) using vanilla
versions or extended/modified variants of the various techniques taught
in the course. They would also be able to state open problems in the
area and their current complexity statuses.
