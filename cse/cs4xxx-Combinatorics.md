# Learning Objectives

The objective of this course is to introduce the students to
various techniques in combinatorics by guiding them
through a set of carefully chosen problems.

# Learning Outcome

After successful completion of this course, a student will be able to

1.	Analyse a given combinatorial problem with a view to 
	solve it by applying one of the standard techniques 
	they learned.

2.	Slightly extend some of the techniques learned and
	apply the extended technique to	solve harder problems.

3.	Describe clearly a few open problems in the area and
	their current status.

# Syllabus

## Elementary techniques (to be reviewed)

Bijective proofs, mathematical induction, pigeonhole principle, 
double counting, parity arguments, and inclusion-exclusion principle.

## Advanced techniques (to be introduced) 

*Generating functions.*
Ordinary, exponential and other special generating functions, formal power series. 

*Probabilistic arguments.*
Positive probability based existence arguments, moment based arguments,
alteration technique, Lovász local lemma.

*Linear Algebraic arguments.*
Dimensionality arguments, orthogonality and rank arguments.

## Problem selection

The problems to introduce and illustrate the power of the
above techniques will be chosen from these areas: 
sets, partitions, sequences, permutations, graphs, partial orders,
algorithms, geometry and number theory.
