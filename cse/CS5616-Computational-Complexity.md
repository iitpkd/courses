**Course Objective: **This is a first course in computational complexity
theory designed for graduate and motivated undergraduate students that
introduces the basic time and space complexity classes, randomized
complexity class and parallel complexity classes. The students also
learn about typical problems in these classes. Through the classical
results covered, students would learn about the relations between some
of these complexity classes.

**Learning Outcomes: **Upon successful completion of this course,
students are expected to

1.  Know and state the relationship between various complexity classes
    studied in the course
2.  State and explain the classical results in computational complexity
    theory

**Teaching Methodology : **Classroom lectures

**Assessment Methods : **Primarily through written examinations. Some
weightage for student presentations is recommended, if the class size is
small.
