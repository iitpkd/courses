# Learning Objectives

This course concentrates on recognizing and solving convex optimization problems that arise in applications. 

# Learning outcome

At the end of the course student will be able to define appropriate optimization problem for a given practical problem. Student will be able to  implement code and solve an optimization problem using MATLAB and CVX.
