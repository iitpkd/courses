This course will introduce the student to the basic concepts
involved in the design and implementation of an operating system. Students will be made
familiar to the important modules of operating systems like process management, memory
management, file systems, synchronization primitives and exception handling. Important
data structures used in the design of these modules will be introduced. The accompanying
lab course CS3510 is intended to give students an illustration of the concepts introduced in
the theory course.

# Learning outcome:

Students will be able to develop an understanding of how an 
operating functions as a middle layer between the hardware of a computer and the user
programs and the various tasks involved in this. By the end of this course, students will be
able to appreciate the design issues and concepts underlying some of the well known
operating systems and compare the pros and cons of various design options and various
issues involved in the design of a large software.


# Syllabus

* Process Management : Scheduling (essential topics: context-switch, unix fork,

* Synchronization Primitives and Problems, Deadlocks (essential topics: Peterson&#39;s
algorithm, monitors)

* Memory Management : Virtual Memory, Demand Paging (essential topics: fragmentation, pinning, Belady&#39;s anomaly, thrashing)

* File systems; I/O Management (essential topics: DMA, delayed writes, elevator
algorithm). Security.
