# Learning Objectives
To learn key algorithms, methods, and models commonly used in data science today along with the mathematical theory as well as the engineering details. 

# Learning outcome
At the end of the course, the students should be

1. aware of classical problems, and commonly encountered problems and their solutions
able to find relevant family of classical problems, and recent literature given a new problem to solve

2. aware of the philosophy and logic behind development of some key algorithms, that will help them to appreciate and grow taste towards foundations of data science

3. confident to study and analyse different types of datasets 

4. able to build mathematical problem behind any practical problem and find out appropriate mathematical theories to proceed

5. able to select proper algorithm and implement it depending on the problem and dataset

6. able to analyse the outcome and develop upon shortcomings

7. aware of best practices to carry out experiments and present results
