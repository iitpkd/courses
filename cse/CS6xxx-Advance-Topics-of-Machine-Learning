# Learning Objectives

The objective of the course is to equip the student to recognize and solve modern machine learning problems those arise in practical applications. 

# Learning outcome

At the end of this course students will be able to implement and use some of the state-of-the-art techniques of machine learning. They will be able to compare pros and cons of various methods  in terms of using them to solve some real world problems. Students will be able to analyse the complexity of an optimization problem and its solution. 

# Syllabus

*Hierarchical Bayesian models: generative models, Topic models, Bayesian nonparametrics 

*Deep learning, artificial neural networks, State-of-art  multi layered neural network.

*Large scale optimization :   Subgradient method, Proximal method, Primal-dual proximal methods, Alternating Direction method for multipliers 

*Distributed Computing : parallel programming and  Map-reduce framework, High Performance Computing.

*Sequential learning: Bayesian sequential learning, stochastic gradient descent

*Kernel Learning, multi view spatio-temporal learning, structure prediction

*Privacy-aware learning
