# Learning Objectives
This is an intermediate course on algorithm design. The first
part of this course is intended to make students familiar with some basic graph
algorithms and their efficiency analysis. The second
part of this course course will provide a detailed introduction to different algorithm design paradigms with illustrative problems.
The third part of this course is looking at designing algorithms for the classical network flow problem. The last part of this course will deal
with computationally hard problems and tackling them using approximation algorithms.

# Learning Outcome
To develop the ability to analyze the running time and prove the correctness of basic algorithms. 

To be able to design efficient algorithms for moderately difficult computational problems, using various algorithm design techniques taught in the
course. 

To be able to prove hardness of NP-Hard problems using simple reductions. 

To be able to do performance analysis of simple approximation algorithms.
