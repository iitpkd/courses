# Learning Objectives
This is an intermediate course on algorithm design.
The first part of this course is intended to make students familiar with
some basic graph algorithms and their efficiency analysis. The second
part of this course course will provide a detailed introduction to
different algorithm design paradigms with illustrative problems. The
third part of this course is looking at designing algorithms for the
classical network flow problem. The last part of this course will deal
with computationally hard problems and tackling them using approximation
algorithms.

# Learning Outcomes

-   To develop the ability to analyze the running time and prove the
    correctness of basic algorithms.
-   To be able to design efficient algorithms for moderately difficult
    computational problems, using various algorithm design techniques
    taught in the course.
-   To be able to prove the hardness of NP-Hard problems using simple
    reductions.
-   To be able to do performance analysis of simple approximation
    algorithms.
