# Learning Objectives
Course should provide a formal connection between
algorithmic problem solving and the theory of languages and automata and
develop them into a mathematical (and less magical) view towards
algorithmic design and in general computation itself. The course should
in addition clarify the practical view towards the applications of these
ideas in the engineering part of CS.

# Syllabus

Pushdown Automata.

Turing Machines & Recursive Languages: Mathematical modelling of
computation, Deterministic Turing Machines, Church-Turing Thesis,
