# Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this course is to show how to use the theory of probability to describe and predict the behavior of real systems that use fixed resources to handle random demands. The course begin with an introduction part where the preliminaries needed for the remainder of the course will the covered. After the introduction, we study the simplest type of queueing discipline known as birth-and-death types. Later, we move on to the slightly complex M/G/1 queue. Finally, we will spend some time exploring different type of queuing networks. 


# Learning Outcome

Upon successful completion of this course, students are expected to:

* Define and explain basic concepts in Poisson and Markov processes
* Differentiate between different queueing disciplines
* Derive and apply main formulas for some properties (such as stationary probabilities, average waiting and system time, expected number of customers in the que, etc.) for birth-and-death type queues
* Calculate the traffic intensity, blocked traffic and the utilization of some queueing systems
* Retain and apply the mathematical concepts discussed over the duration of the course.

# Syllabus

* **Introduction and preliminaries**: motivation and examples, the Poisson process, Markov chains, Markov processes and other necessary background, Kendallâ€™s notation

* **Birth-and-death type queues**: the M/M/1 queue, the M/M/1-N queue, the M/M/c queue 

* **The M/G/1 queue**: queue-length distribution, waiting-time distribution, Busy period 

* **Networks, Series, and Cyclic Queues**:  series queues, open Jackson networks, closed Jackson networks, cyclic queues, extensions of Jackson networks, non-Jackson networks
