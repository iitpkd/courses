# Learning Objectives

This is an intermediate level course in computer science field and assumes background in algorithm, programming and introductory knowledge of probability and linear algebra. The main objective of the course is to introduce student with methodologies and applications of various topics of machine learning.  The course will also provide sufficient background to motivate students to take up advanced levels courses related to machine learning, deep learning, bioinformatics, robotics, Artificial intelligence etc. 

# Learning outcome

Upon successful completion, the students will be able to  implement few machine learning models like regression classification and clustering and will be able to learn models from data and evaluate models on test data. 

# Syllabus

*Introduction:* introduction to the course, recap of linear algebra and probability theory basics.

*Regression:* Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Sensitivity Analysis, Multivariate Regression.

*Bayesian Classification*: Naive Bayes, Parameter Estimation (ML, MAP), Sequential Pattern Classification.

*Evaluation and Model Selection:* ROC Curves, Evaluation Measures, Significance tests.

*Non-parametric Methods:* k-Nearest Neighbours, Parzen Window.

*Discriminative Learning models:* Logistic Regression, Perceptrons, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines.

*Dimensionality Reduction:* Principal Component Analysis, Fischer's Discriminant Analysis.

*Decision Trees:* Splitting Criteria, CART.

*Ensemble Methods:* Boosting, Bagging, Random Forests.

*Clustering:* Partitional, Hierarchical, density based clustering.
