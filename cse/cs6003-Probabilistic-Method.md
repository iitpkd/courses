# Course Objective: 
The objective is to introduce students to the
probabilistic method, a fundamental and powerful technique in
theoretical computer science.

# Course Contents

1. **The basic probabilistic method**. Illustration of the basic method using
Ramsey numbers, Dominating sets in graphs and Hypergraph coloring (8 lectures)

2. **First Moment  Method.** Linearity of Expectation. Direct  Examples
Derandomization using conditional expectations.  Alterations. Moments (10 lectures)

3. **Second Moment Method. **Chebyshev inequalities, introduction to
concentration. Higher moments and Chernoff bound. Dimensionality reduction. (12
lectures)

4. Selected topics from Lovasz  Local Lemma, Correlation Inequalities,
Martingales and Tight Concentration (12 lectures)

# Learning Outcomes

1.  To familiarize with various random constructions that show the
    existence of the required combinatorial object.
2.  To be able to apply the various techniques taught in the course to
    come up with existential and constructive proofs for the existence
    of various mathematical objects.
3.  To familiarize with basic pseudo-random objects and derandomization
    techniques.
4.  To be able to construct pseudo-random objects according to the needs
    of the problem and come up with efficient derandomization techniques
    for these objects.
