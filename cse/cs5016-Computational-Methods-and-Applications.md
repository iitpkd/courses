# Course Objectives: 

The main objective of this course is to introduce
students to some of the key computational techniques used in modelling
and simulation of real-world phenomena. This course is designed to
expose students to techniques and methods from a variety of disciplines,
not normally encompassed in a single course. Unlike other courses
focused more specifically on algorithms, data structures or numerical
analysis, this course emphasizes hands-on programming to understand a
variety of scientific phenomena and computational methods.
