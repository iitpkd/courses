# Course Objective

The objective of the course is to help students learn basic algorithms
and their rigorous analysis. The analysis will involve proofs of
correctness and efficiency analysis of implementation using appropriate
data structures. The course also will provide a detailed introduction to
the different algorithm design paradigms for problems from various
domains.

# Course Contents
**Preliminaries : **Asymptotic notations, Efficiency of algorithms, Notions of time and space complexity. (3 lectures)
**Design Paradigms: **Greedy Strategy, Divide & Conquer and Dynamic Programming with applications in different problem domains like sorting, searching, string matching, scheduling and simulation.   (15 lectures)
**Graph Algorithms : **Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms, Shortest path algorithms, Network flow algorithms. (24 lectures)

# Learning Outcomes

1.  To acquire basic mathematical tools and techniques for algorithm
    design and analysis.
2.  To familiarize with basic data structures and develop the ability to
    choose the appropriate data structure for designing efficient
    algorithms.
3.  To develop the ability to analyze the running time and prove the
    correctness of algorithms.
4.  To be able to design efficient algorithms for computational problems
    using various algorithm design techniques taught in the course.
