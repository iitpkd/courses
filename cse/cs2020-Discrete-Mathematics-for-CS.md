# Course Objective

The objective of this course is to cover some of the topics that lie at the
foundation of many areas of Computer Science and Engineering. Areas like
Algorithm Design and Analysis, Operating Systems, Compilers, Databases and
Networks make extensive use of counting techniques and graph theory -- the
major topics covered in this course.

# Learning Outcomes

The student should be able to identify a variety of problems studied in
computer science as questions about graphs, partial orders or other discrete
structures. The student should be able to apply the techniques learned here to
analyse such questions.
