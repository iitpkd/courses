# Learning Objective

Rigorous mathematical reasoning based on Logic and Set Theory is the basic
method of Computer Science. Moreover, Logic is a very important tool in many
areas of Computer Science like Computer Architecture (Logic Gates), Software
Engineering (Specification and Verification), Programming Languages (Semantics,
Logic Programming), Databases (Relational Algebra and SQL), Artificial
Intelligence (Automatic Theorem Proving), Algorithms (Complexity and
Expressiveness), and Theory of Computation (General Notions of Computability).
The first objective of this course is to introduce the students to Set Theory
and Logic and train them for rigorous mathematical reasoning. The second
objective is to equip them with the background needed to learn the specific
topics in Logic needed for other areas of Computer Science. 

# Learning Outcome

After successful completion of this course, a student will be able to

1.	Follow a rigorous mathematical proof and identify gaps in reasoning if any.
2.	Convert sentences in natural language to logical expressions and vice versa.
3.	Apply standard proof techniques to prove statements about simple
	mathematical structures like Natural Numbers and Groups. 
4.	Prove properties of recursively defined structures using structural induction.
